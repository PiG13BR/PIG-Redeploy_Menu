## DESCRIPTION
- This is just a **REDEPLOY** system, it will teleport the player to the redeploy position, so make sure you set up a BIS respawn point, a simple marker with "respawn" variable name should do it.
- Add this in object's init field: `[this, "Name of the respawn"] call PIG_fnc_setRedeployPosition`;
